# Qwkipedia iOS

## Import Notes
1. This project is using a package library called cocoa pods. This is common for importing 3rd party packages in iOS. That is the purpose of the pod files. These can just be left alone. The most important this is to ***make sure you open the qwkipedia.xcworkspace not the qwkipedia.xcodeproj*** when you are working on the app. 
2. This project was built to support iOS 13.6 and higher
3. Device Orientation is set to Portrait only
4. This project was built using Xcode 12.4
