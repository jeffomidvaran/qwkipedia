# Qwkipedia iOS

## Import Notes
1. This project was built to support iOS 13.6 and higher
2. Device Orientation is set to Portrait only
3. This project was built using Xcode 12.4
4. The "inw_protocol_get_quic_image_block_invoke dlopen libquic failed" error message is caused by Firebase and for the moment looks like it unavoidable
